    In such instances of chronic pelvic pain, we may need to get a pelvic examination by the Gynecologist, a high vaginal 
swab for gm stain and culture and a pelvic ultrasound (also to look at 
the post void residual urinary volume). The therapeutic options for 
whatever is detected can be limited to: (Pasted from <a href="http://www.upointmd.com/therapic_page.php" target="_blank">http://www.upointmd.com/<wbr>therapic_page.php</a> )<br>
<br><h4>Antibiotics</h4>
	
	  
	    May be helpful for patients with the <font color="#0000ff" size="+1">Infection</font> domain. Should only be used to treat positive cultures.<br><br><h4>Pelvic Physical Therapy</h4>
	
	  
	    May be helpful for patients with the <font color="#996633" size="+1">Tenderness of Skeletal Muscles</font> domain<br><br>
Pelvic floor physical therapy is the best technique to treat pelvic 
floor spasm. Therapy may include myofascial release, stretching and 
paradoxical relaxation. <br><br><h4>Dietary Modifications</h4>
	  
        
           May be helpful for patients with <font color="#ff0000" size="+1">Urinary</font> or <font size="+1">Organ Specific</font> domains<br><br>
Some people find certain food triggers that worsen symptoms. They are 
not the same for everybody, but common ones include caffeine, spicy 
foods, alcohol and wheat products. Try eliminating from the diet and see
 the impact on symptoms. If elimination doesn't help at all, you don't 
need to keep avoiding them.
<br><br><h4>Psychologic support</h4>
	  
        
          May be helpful for patients with the <font color="#ff7f00" size="+1">Psychosocial</font> domain<br><br>
Pelvic pain is not "all in your head" but having chronic pain can 
increase stress, cause depression and make other stressful events in 
life more difficult to handle. Depression can be treated with counseling
 and medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress reduction can 
greatly reduce the impact of symptoms. Short term therapy with 
anti-anxiety medications may be used with caution during a symptom 
flare.
