    Thanks for posting your patient input here:http://care.udhc.co.in/INPUT/displayIssueGraphically.jsp?topic_id=253<br><br>Your patient is a 65 years old lady suffering from Parkinson's for the last 7 yrs and suffering from Crohn's disease for last 8 months. <br><br>Please let us have the details of her current symptoms due to Parkinson's as well as Crohn's. Are these two problems currently well controlled? How much is she able to walk daily?<br><br>How was her Crohn's diagnosed 8 months back? What were her symptoms and what tests were done? Please also mention her recent BP records, weight and height.<br><br>Please let us know since when she has started having the <strong><strong>intense pain in her legs, knee and below</strong></strong>. You have mentioned they are more intense during the night. These are possible nocturnal calf muscle cramps and our suggestion for your local physician is that she may at bedtime take a tablet of Paracetamol 500 mg along with a half tablet of Tramadol (available as Contramol-DT 50 mg). <br><br>She may apply Myolaxin ointment over her right knee and take paracetamol 500 mg during intense pain. For her stomach bloating she can take Omeprazole 20 mg and Domperidone 10 mg (Omez-D) combination for a few days. <br><br>best regards,<br><br>ArogyaUDHC team<br><br><br>
