    The patient suffered a motorcycle injury 2 months prior to contacting 
the ArogyaUDHC social worker Mr Kar in Mathabhanga. The motorcycle 
handle penetrated his skin above the right knee. Initially, his local 
doctor sutured the area and gave antibiotics, but later the patient 
developed a high-grade intermittent fever with chills and a reddish 
patchy and nodular inflammatory lesion which he photographed and emailed
 to us. <br><br>After his arrival at PCMS, Bhopal on 6th November, 2012 
he underwent incision and drainage of an identified pus point. The pus 
culture was sterile for bacteria although it showed filamentous 
organisms on a wet mount (Figure 3). A fungal culture couldn't&nbsp; be done 
due to logistic reasons. :-(<br><br>He continued to have low grade fever
 but went home on oral antifungals (tablet itraconazole 200mg twice a 
day for three months). His temperature charting (attached figure 4) sent
 to us after he went home showed continued low grade fever spikes but 
eventually subsided after a few days.<br><br>He remained largely well 
till date (23rd March 2013) but for recent occasions when he experienced
 some discomfort in the same region (skin of right knee) with even some 
pus discharge from another new opening. He arrived back at PCMS, Bhopal 
on 21st March 2013. Has been planned for more extensive debridement on 
the 25th of March 2013. <br><br>Figure 5 shows the debrided tissue that 
on histopatholigical examination looked normal. However post operative 
he continues to ooze pus and secretions from the wound. Attached is an 
image of the wound on April 24 2013 (Figure 6).<br><br>He was last (1st part of May 2013)&nbsp; reviewed by a plastic surgeon in North Bengal Medical College, Dr Parthasarathi Ghosh who advised further conservative management.<br>
