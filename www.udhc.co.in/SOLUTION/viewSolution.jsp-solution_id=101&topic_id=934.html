    <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="4">PCMS physician's update (fall to early winter 2013): <br></font></p><font size="4">The patient was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis 
during her first presentation to PCMS (at the time of Final MBBS 
University exams Spring 2013) and radiology of her hands revealed 
significant erosions. She was started on DMARDs (Methotrexate and 
Chloroquin) along with bridge therapy with prednisolone. Although the prednisolone was stopped on her subsequent prescriptions (last she was seen here twice on summer of 2013) and currently it seems 
she is still on prednisolone and examination reveals acneiform lesions 
and facial swelling suggestive of iatrogenic Cushing's. This time her 
steroids were put on a tapering dose again and she was counseled on regular follow up (and this web based record was created to facilitate the same). She was continued on her earlier DMARDs and NSAIDs sos. </font>
