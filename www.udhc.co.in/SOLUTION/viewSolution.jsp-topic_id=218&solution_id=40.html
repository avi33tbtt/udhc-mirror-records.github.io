    Patient was admitted in PCMS, Bhopal for her complaints and was provided supportive treatment for her painful bony deformity. A consultation was sought from Physiatrist Dr Ganesh Joshi (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://crcbhopal.nic.in/" target="_blank">http://crcbhopal.nic.in/</a>). Patient was started injectable and oral Vit. D, calcium and pancreatic enzyme supplements for malabsorption and tramadol for her pain.

Date: Wed, Apr 17, 2013 at 12:28 AM<br>Subject: Re: {IAPMR} Fwd: 23 year old lady with spinal pain and deformity due to rickets (due to Malabsorption)<br>Cc: "<a href="mailto:iapmr@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">iapmr@googlegroups.com</a>" &lt;<a href="mailto:iapmr@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">iapmr@googlegroups.com</a>&gt;<br>
<br><div>After going through patient's history and images, and&nbsp;based on my experience ( i am not an expert Endo or GI specialist)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. It seems she is suffering with whole body severe pain due to 
severe Vitamin D deficiency. She is 23 year old, so she is suffering 
with Osteomalacia (not rickets) seconadry to&nbsp;Malabsorption syndrome. She
 had&nbsp;nociceptive pain, images suggest multiple pseudofractures (Looser's
 zones) in clavicle, tibia, humerus, left neck of femur etc, deformities
 and muscle weakness. You can get labs for serum vit-d level, alkaline 
phosphate, urine and serum calcium.</div>


<div>2. Due to vitamin-D deficiency, she has also developed decreased 
calcium absorption leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary 
hyperparathyroidism might also be causing her bony pain. I believe her 
renal functions to be normal. But better to&nbsp;rule out renal 
osteodystrophy (for secondary hyperparathyroidism)&nbsp;by getting serum 
calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and rest of renal 
functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>


<div>3. She need a daily high dose of vitamin-D either oral or intramuscular for 6-8 weeks, along with calcium. </div>
<div>4. Later continue&nbsp;daily supplements of Vitamin -D and calcium. I am sure she will do well after 3-4 months of treatment. </div>
<div>5. I feel, it is better to avoid&nbsp;any surgical intervention for her 
spine at this stage. It can be considered later stage once she is more 
functional, pain free and after addressing her nutritional issues. </div>
<div>6. She needs a regular rehab program with exercises for muscle 
weakness, lower extremity deformities. If no contraindication, she can 
have NSAID's or tramadol for her pain&nbsp;to make her participate in 
exercises program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have seen several similar cases like this before ( remember the 
one&nbsp;female pt (in her 30's,&nbsp;probably in 2001), pt came in wheelchair 
with weakness and severe bony pain, admitted&nbsp;in aiims rehab unit, after 
work up (primary hyperparathyroidism),&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chumber did the parathyroid 
surgery, after completion of rehab patient went home by walking without 
any AD), they do well after treatment with Vit-D and calcium. </div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>More than the work up for <b>Shwachmanâ€“Diamond syndrome</b> 
(exocrine pancreatic dysfunction), this patient need Vit-D, Calcium and 
her nutrition need to be addressed. Her deformities (including spinal 
deformities) could have been prevented if this was addressed earlier. I 
do have a&nbsp;friend (Anesthesiologist), who does not have a pancreas (due 
to trauma, and then surgery&nbsp;during his childhood), but doing well like 
any other human being with pancreatic enzymes and other nutritional 
supplements. </div><br>
