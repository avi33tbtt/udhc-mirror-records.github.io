    Thanks for your patient input which is visible online here after de-identification:http://care.udhc.co.in/INPUT/displayIssueGraphically.jsp?topic_id=272<br><br>Please find below an expert opinion from Dr Prakash Agarwal, one of the Vitreo-Retinal Surgeons in our network:<br><br>sir<br>
<br>
thanks for sharing details. i went through the details. as u can see<br>
the pt has got good vision in right eye so nothing for right eye at<br>
the moment.<br>
<br>
left has poor vision.. 20/500. we can think about treating the left eye.<br>
we need to know few things.<br>
Q1. is there any lens opacity in left which could be attributing to<br>
poor vision. since the pt is already 60 yrs.<br>
Q2. we need to get a OCT (optical tomogram ) of both eyes which will<br>
help us rule out retinal macular edema as a cause of poor vision.<br>
<br>
once we know above two things we can plan some thing.<br>
About Treatment of RP per se:<br>
i discussed with some colleagues at AIIMS, New Delhi. they are doing studies<br>
with &nbsp;stem cells. result &nbsp;are ok. not very promising though.<br><br>regards, ArogyaUDHC team<br><br>PS:Dr Rakesh Biswas is morally and legally responsible for this suggestion 
and ArogyaUDHC team is working under the hypothesis that informational 
support (such as this) for the patient and local physician is likely to 
be beneficial toward achieving better health outcomes."
